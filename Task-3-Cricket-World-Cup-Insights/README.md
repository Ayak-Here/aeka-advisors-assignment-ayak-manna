# Task 3 – Cricket World Cup Insights

## Project Overview
This task involves building an interactive Business Intelligence dashboard to analyze Cricket World Cup data.  
The dashboard was created using Google Looker Studio and focuses on country performance, player analysis, comparisons, and trends.

---

## Data Used
The analysis is based on Cricket World Cup datasets obtained from Kaggle.  
These datasets are originally compiled from sources such as Wikipedia and ESPN Cricinfo.

The data includes:
- Player batting statistics
- Match-level information including teams and results

---

## Dataset Availability
The complete datasets are not included in this repository due to file size limitations and because the analysis is performed directly in Google Looker Studio.

For reference, small sample CSV files are provided in the `data/` folder to show the structure of the data used.

---

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets – data preparation and cleaning
- Google Looker Studio – dashboard creation and visualization

---

## Dashboard Features
- Country-wise performance analysis using filters
- Player-level analysis of runs and highest scores
- Player vs Player comparison charts
- Visualization of highest individual scores
- Geospatial visualization using country-level data

---

## Geospatial Note
Venue or city-level data was not available in the dataset.  
Therefore, country-level geospatial visualization was implemented using team information.
